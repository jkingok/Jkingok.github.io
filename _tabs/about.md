*Hi there!*

I'm **Joshua King** from over here in Australia.

I'm a software developer who has been working with a low profile for many years now.

I've got interests in technology in most general fields but I'm drawn and enjoy playing with Linux and the command line.

I'm not much of a graphic designer so this will be spartan and minimalist but it's the content you're here for after all.
