Part two of the Big Day was that it was Software Freedom Day and the Perth Linux Users Group had a meetup in the evening. I couldnâ€™t in good conscience miss that opportunity given the shared heritage of myself attending Linux.conf.au in 2014 (I wore my shirt all day as proof) and themselves hosting it.  
  
Iâ€™m not great with names but I met at least Percy, James, Nick, Jack and (sorry) others, on my way back (well, a wide detour) from DDD Perth.  
  
Iâ€™m now a signed-up if only virtual member of PLUG. Perth is a big place itâ€™s hard to get out to see everyone when you donâ€™t live or work near the city itself.  
  
But I did learn an Easter egg and if youâ€™re in or go to PLUG youâ€™ll know what I mean when I say youâ€™ll immediately know from the car park (I did!) if youâ€™re in the right place.
