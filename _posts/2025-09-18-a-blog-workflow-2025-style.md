Let's pull back the covers and go technical which I *love* to do. Given I've learned a bit from some documentation
I've read already, let's also **give back**. That's very important!

So... here's how this blog was born and made to fit my lifestyle:

## Philosophy

I need to blog in my spare time *only*. Those spare times my be as ridiculous as on a bus or in bed. So it's gotta be
portable. So I'm doing it on my phone, or my tablet, or at a stretch in front of TV... my Chromebook.

I'm sorry to disappoint people, but yeah... Linux doesn't quite fit in there (I weep for my **Nokia N9** and the **PinePhone** didn't quite get there for me),
so that phone is an *iPhone* and the tablet is an *iPad*.

## Minimizing my social accounts

I didn't want to create another account, yet I am realistic enough to try to go where the people are, so I haven't revived [my Blogger](https://techtransit.blogspot.com), but I could.
(I should probably put a redirect there at least).

I have a *GitHub* account so that's where I'm at.

I'm familiar with **static site generators**, they are awesome, I never want to go back to a *WordPress*-like environment, it costs more, and is risky. Yes in the dark past I did have a site hacked in the past (weak password).

I have experience with *Hugo* from my partner's site (go [here, please](https://garryjohnsmusic.com)), but I'm not going to swim against the tide, so ready-made *Jekyll* on *GitHub Pages* it is then.

But I definitely want to not be lazy and obvious, so I did at least seek out a *different* theme, and I've landed on [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/).

And here we are.

## Writing posts

So I'm going to be writing posts on *iPhones* and *iPads*. Great. I'm going to be needing a Markdown editor and a Git client, and *eventually* a way of automating things.

I had some years ago bought a license to [Working Copy](https://workingcopy.app/) and thus I'm using that and it's extremely powerful.

As a tech enthusiast and developer, I of course early adopted *iOS 26* and *iPadOS 26*, and the good bit here is **the Notes app can Export to Markdown** including images and links, the works. So out of the box creating of posts is handled.

## Testing the blog out

This is where my *Chromebook* came in. Even though in all practicality I probably have zero readers, I wanted a test environnment. So I am using the *Debian* (my favourite) Linux environment
built into my Chromebook for a local install of *Jekyll* for previewing things.

## Automation

I'm looking into automating a few things and exploring further (it's only been a couple of days) things. for example:
* I need to automate the *front matter* necessary for my posts. I expect I'll either use *Shortcuts* or *Pythonista* or both to do this. (The file names need to change as well.)
* I need to automate some minor cleanups required from exporting from *Notes*. (The images need to be moved into my `assets` folder from the `_posts` folder.)
* I wonder if I can create and import a post template into *Notes* (I bet I can import *plain text* into Notes, but does it import *Markdown*, and will it leave the front matter unmolested?)

So there you have it. I'll be sure to update you as I improve this process.

## Bonus: Imagery

If you haven't figured it out, I am not that good at drawing but I'm very confident at writing. But I have enough of an eye to realise that all of my text can look... well... bland.

So I've gone modern and I'm curating a "house style" and using *Gemini* to generate hero images for my posts. I know they appear a bit big on this theme, but tweaks like that for later.

I will assert my text content is *not* AI-generated.
