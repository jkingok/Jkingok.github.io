As many of you know and as is the implied theme of this blog, I've been going through a transition.

Foor those of you wondering, though no comments yet... it's going well.

There remains, as I complete my induction the need for the usual disclaimer:

** The content of this site do not reflect the views or opinions or position of anyone but me. These are not official comments of my current or previous employers. **

With that done, some more _technical_ updates.

If you followed along with my history here's some updates:
* I'm happy to report that my _pump stopping_ smart switch _does_ work. I exercised it beyond the ten minute limit yesterday and the switch itself _has not fried_ during the recent heat wave.
* I'm a convert to the [Risky Business](https://risky.biz) podcast. Thank you for the recommendation but why did you _wait so long_?
* _Unfortnately_ as a result of the _introductory_ nature of my new work, I'm back on (sigh) _Windows 11_. I'm thinking of buying a new laptop. It must have a built-in Ethernet and HDMI and preferably a touch screen, suggestions welcome.
* My exercise is going well, in the new job I can walk everywhere and barely need a bus.

More soon, that train is entering the final station!

😉
