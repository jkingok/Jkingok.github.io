Here's a quick Android Tip: if you are using _GBoard_ as your keyboard, explore the
"four square" options button. Especially useful for code editing is the "Text editing"
option that you can promote to the main button bar.

This replaced the hold-spacebar-and-drag option of my _iPhone_ which _does_ work here too
but which appears to be limited to left and right.
