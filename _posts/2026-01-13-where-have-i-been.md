OK so I did let this atrophy for a while. Life gets in the way, but there are things now that dictate doubling-down and making this my primary output.

Welcome to everyone who wants to follow my journey beyond my previous job and into the next.

A reminder that there should be an [RSS feed](https://blog.jking.id.au/feed.xml) and I am exploring enabling comments shortly. In the meantime feel free to reach out via GitHub, I've [opened this issue](https://github.com/jkingok/Jkingok.github.io/issues/3).

Here we go...
