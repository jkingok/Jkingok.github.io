At least for me, as a Google Reeder refugee (thank you [Reeder app](https://www.reederapp.com)), a blog without RSS cannot be called a blog at all.  
  
A note that your average GitHub Pages blog might not automatically get an RSS feed depending on whose template you follow. I think the switch to Chirpy let me down here.  
  
Anyway it‚Äôs fixed now, as is my vanity domain name. Find this blog at [Blog.jking.id.au ](https://blog.jking.id.au)and the feed [here.](https://blog.jking.id.au/feed.xml)  
  
Shortly I‚Äôll add it into the site template so feed readers can detect it too.  
  
*Tip*: While the Chirpy theme will add an RSS icon to the sidebar, it does not appear to automatically add the meta tags that **Jekyll-feed** offers and that readers need to be automatic. To fix that, add  
  
```
{% feed_meta %}

```
  
To a file called _includes/metadata-hook.html .  
  
You‚Äôre welcome.
