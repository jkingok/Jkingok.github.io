Every once in a while you have an itch to scratch and there’s a good enough solution already out there.  
  
If you’re following the blog, you’ll note that I wanted to post in an open-source-ish way my Shortcuts for posting to this very blog.  
  
The now-old-fashioned way of doing that was mechanically taking screenshots, cropping and joining them. In fact I probably have a Shortcut for that, but it’s redundant.  
  
**[PicSew](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1208145167)** is an app for cropping and joining things but the feature I was drawn to was “Scrollshot Recording” which is in the **Pro** add-on. (Yes you must pay, and that’s okay.)  
  
And it’s seamless.  
  
You use something I did not know about which was Screen Broadcast to an app - long press on Screen Recording in the Control Centre and select PicSew.  
  
Go back to the app (Shortcuts in this case), scroll from one end to the other, pause and then you’re done!  
  
In a case of being “meta”, here is this post according to PicSew:
