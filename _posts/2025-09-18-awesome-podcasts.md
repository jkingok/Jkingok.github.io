# Awesome - Podcasts  
*In the spirit of a lot of **GitHub **directories, here‚Äôs an initial contribution of my lists:*

### Security Now  
Running continuously for over 20 years,* Steve Gibson *is a live-long-and-prosper legend.  
  
Go here for your light and informative cyber security awareness. You‚Äôll learn **a lot**.

### **Python Bytes**  
They say direct to your ear buds but for me it‚Äôs most often to my car stereo. It‚Äôs a quick hit of information to keep pace with Python - a language I hope to get more use of (if you look back the best things I‚Äôve done are in Python).  
  
I‚Äôll note that this is a nice and short podcast a week, compared to *Security Now* above with often clocks in over 3 hours now!

###   
### ABC News Daily  
Well at least week-daily‚Ä¶ and the shortest I tend to listen to. A 15 minute investment and I tend to speed up my podcasts‚Ä¶  
  
One news interview relevant to Australian ears.

### Politics Now/The Party Room  
This is a politics podcast that struggles to remain fair and balanced. It is after all coming from the government broadcaster.  
  
I‚Äôve been listening long enough to the weekly edition *The Party Room *that is incorporated in this feed that have nostalgic urges to beg co-host *Fran Kelly* to return to the karaoke segment but I guess the *Question Time *replacement really is more on-brand.

### If You‚Äôre Listening  
I‚Äôm a big Matt Bevan fan. I‚Äôm so pleased the ABC promoted him from just a podcast to also video (YouTube/iView) and even a broadcast playout on ABC News.  
  
A deep dive into something you didn‚Äôt know that you didn‚Äôt know that is tangentially aligned to current issues that‚Äôs not afraid to go off on a tangent (soil? Really?) especially on the ‚Äúbonus episodes‚Äù, it has come a long way from it Trump origins.  
  
And‚Ä¶ this is the first one on my list that I can sneak into a playlist with my partner.

### Mr Ballen‚Äôs Strange Dark and Mysterious  
This one comes from my partner and exactly in reverse to above, it was YouTube first then a podcast.  
  
It‚Äôs a nice easy listen (or watch) to calm things in an evening, except where there‚Äôs an anxiety inducing story about caving - I do get claustrophobic from the vivid storytelling alone.

Enjoy!
