Welcome to the obligatory first post. There always has to be one!

I'm glad that you've stopped by.

This is a fresh *attempt* at a public-facing blog for myself.

I am a software developer who has worked in an industry that demanded a low profile and I faithfully complied.
However I've reached the stage where I'm attempting to take more control of next steps in my career, which
necessitates a more open approach.

Please get in touch. I expect one of the easiest ways to get in touch is via **GitHub** on which this blog
is hosted. I have yet to, and probably won't, attach comments here.

My intent with this blog is the classic *diary* and to organically, literally, give you confidence in my
"proof of life" as it were. I am assuredly **not** a robot.

And by the way, "G'Day" from Australia.
