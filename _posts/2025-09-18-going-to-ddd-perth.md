Depending on when you read this, I'm either going or have been to [DDD Perth 2025](https://dddperth.com).

This is my first time since *linux.conf.au 2014*, which was also in Perth, to go out to a major conference.

My goal is to **try** and network a bit, if you've read this then I probably achieved my mission and thank you for following up!
