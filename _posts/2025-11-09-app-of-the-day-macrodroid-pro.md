This week I've been settling into my *Google Pixel 7* and replacing some of the functions I
Was used to from iPhone and in many cases going beyond.

On iPhone I was somewhat spoiled by *Shortcuts* - the built-in automation system.
While Google has yet to go so far, because Android has long been open the capability is
well established. There are many options from the venerable Tasker and Llamasoft's Automate
but in a previous round of Android experimentation I went with Macrodroid and I've chosen to do so
again.

It's important to note that this is not a free option. At least you can go free if you want but
the roadblocks the app enforces (full screen ad on each macro save) are _really_ obstructive.
(I don't so much mind the 5 macro limit, it's effectively a trial).

Once you've know whether you can work within its conventions, do upgrade to *Pro*.

I am using Macrodroid for a couple of useful things, and I'm sure I'll throw more in there as we go:

* My work has restrictions on personal phones, but I can communicate throughout the day via email.
Macrodroid helps me forward my SMSes, missed calls *and notifications* (something I could not do
with Apple's *Shortcuts*) via email.
* Google provides a useful *Now Playing* feature on Pixel phones. As a *Shazam* fan, I'm drawn to this
but it's a bit underwhelming in not being able to export the history or quickly bring up lyrics.
Macrodroid to the rescue.

So if you like fiddling around with programming things, go for your life here. The possibilities
should be somewhat limitless as you can make web requests (in *both* directions!) and run JavaScript
and Java code.

So glad it's a one-time purchase. I would not subscribe to this feature, but it's good that this app
continues to get regular (monthly?) updates. For example. I had an issue with a Webhook trigger and it
was fixed in the next update.

I'm now sharing my macros on my Google Drive
 [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WyF5mhZTfVjsJsPLpHe6RSmkaIPFuGFe).
Please feel free to grab any you like, there's a *README* and comments in the macros themselves.
