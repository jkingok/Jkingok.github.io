If you want proof that half my life, as I state, has indeed passed for me, then follow these links back in time:

* The University period - with thanks to Google, [my Blogger](https://techtransit.blogspot.com) is still alive
* The High school period - with no thanks to the historical owners of Yahoo, RIP Geocities, but thanks to the Archivists (many and varied), in this case the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20110121205958/http://geocities.ws:80/jking_ok/index-2.html)

Anything else is likely a name clash and not related to me, but if you find something and you want to check, get in touch, I'd be curious to know what you find.
