If you want proof that half my life, as I state, has indeed passed for me, then follow these links back in time:

* The University period - with thanks to Google, Blogger is still alive - https://techtransit.blogspot.com
* The High school period - with no thanks to the historical owners of Yahoo, RIP Geocities, but thanks to the Archivists (many and varied) - e.g. https://web.archive.org/web/20110121205958/http://geocities.ws:80/jking_ok/index-2.html

Anything else is likely a name clash and not related to me, but if you find something and you want to check, get in touch, I'd be curious to know what you find.
