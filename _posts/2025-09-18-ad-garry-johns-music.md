*Now any self-respecting site on the 2025 internet needs to be ad-supported right? Well what happens when you're brand new, and you have yet to atract a sponsor? You run a _house ad_ of course!*

And now for something a little different but I promise thereâ€™s a link.  
  
My partner used to have a musical hobby and he is skilled but the motivation of isnâ€™t there. However I find it really nice when one of his songs is slotted in between mainstream music in our *YouTube Music *supermix.  
  
He holds his own. Look him up and give him a listen.
