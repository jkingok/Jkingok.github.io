A tip because I was about to throw my Pixel 7 out the window...

I'd had enough of "app quality" issues, that is, mainstream apps
that I was downloading from Play Store listed as compatible**
only to have them crash at launch.

Ironically most of these apps were the "differentiators" justifying a
Pixel over an iPhone in the first place, including _Dolphin_ and _Kodi_.

The final straw was _Plex_.

**However** by letting time pass the solution turned out to be simple.

_Get onto the Android beta channel!_

The January update has fixed (all of?) the app crashes that I see.

There is of course a _risk_ of issues with betas, but I am not seeing
anything _yet_...

🤞
