This week I made a switch. After finally breaking down and admitting that my
_iPhone 13 mini_ deserved to be repaired due to only being able to charge it
wirelessly, and then being quoted **$500** to fix it (to be fair I did turn up
at the shop, remove the phone from its case and find the back glass smashed),
I took up one of the recent bargains and got a _Google Pixel 7_ on clearance.
That only cost me **$199** and is one year newer. It's a good way for me to
do my every-few-year check into Android.

My initial assessment is that in _Pixel Android 16_ form it is robust and useful
but in no way as easy to use as iOS 18 (iOS 26, well...). My less technical partner
would struggle with the switch.

I have had some surprises and annoyances already.
1. Apple Australia has not made any effort to push us into the interoperable RCS world.
I'd _incorrectly_ assumed this has happened. Boo! I'm now a bit more limited than I'd
anticipated with my partner staying on iPhone.
2. The Pixel is bigger than my mini but I knew that and there is no newer mini from
Apple either. No I don't want an offbrand Android thankyou. Been there, missed the updates.
3. The Switch to Pixel on setup with the USB adaptor in the box was super polished. Now of 
course for me this involved 3 phones. I had already restored my broken mini onto an iPhone SE
(I always have a spare phone ready) before the repair appointment. It did copy more than
I expected but also less than it promised. While it matched a number of apps, none of
them that I checked brought over their data.
4. The hardest thing has been escaping iCloud Passwords. There are of course ways and means
but because of the above I am purposely going into each app anyway.
5. I _immediately_ turned on the _Developer options_ because I want the native Linux container.
6. Split screen and native Gemini is a win.
7. Android Auto is only on par with CarPlay.
8. App quality is variable. I'm seeing more rough edges and crashes still.

But overall I've got more "freedom" from Android in a couple of key areas. Really happy to have
built-in Linux and scripting/automations especially.

And yes, I am still editing this blog on the phone. The workflow has changed slightly though
and there was some rough spots but I can actually test it locally now.
